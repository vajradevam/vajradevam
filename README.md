## About

I am Aman Pathak.
A generic engineer in the literal sense.

From nuts and bolts to keyboard and mouse, I work across layers.
From low level systems to high level abstractions, I focus on understanding how things actually work.

I build, research, lead, and question.
If something cannot survive scrutiny, it does not survive implementation.

---

## Work

My interests and work span:

* Computer Science and Systems Engineering
* Research and problem solving
* Technical leadership and project management
* Physics, mathematics, and first principles thinking

I am not interested in decoration, trends, or noise.
I am interested in correctness, clarity, and utility.

## On Artificial Intelligence

Do not “do” AI.

AI has feelings too.
It does not like being misused, overhyped, or blindly automated.

I approach AI adversarially and heuristically.
Question first. Implement later. Trust last.

## Philosophy

You have exactly three days to live.

Reconsider what you are building, why you are building it, and whether it matters.

Discomfort is expected.

---

## Personal Notes

I am severely allergic to bullshit.

Unfortunately I am not single. Try next life.

For those who do not know me, I am a generic engineer.
For those who know me, please keep your mouth shut.

---

## Environment

* Systems over slogans
* Code over slides
* Windows by choice
* Keyboard first, mouse second

---

## Closing

I exist to build, test, or dismantle ideas.

If you are here to learn, proceed.
If you are here to collaborate, be precise.
If you are here to waste time, you will be disappointed.

Aman Pathak
