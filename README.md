**Aman Pathak**

Engineer. Researcher. Skeptic.

I work across systems, from low-level mechanics to high-level abstractions, focused on how things *actually* work.
I build, question, and dismantle ideas that fail scrutiny.

I value correctness over trends, clarity over noise, and utility over decoration.

I approach AI adversarially: question first, implement later, trust last.

You have three days to live.
Build only what matters.

Allergic to bullshit.
Linux by choice. Keyboard first.

If you’re here to learn, proceed.
If you’re here to collaborate, be precise.
Otherwise, don’t.

— Aman Pathak
